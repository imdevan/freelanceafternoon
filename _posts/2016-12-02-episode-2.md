# Show Notes

## tl;dr

- Devan got ferrets!
- Devan started a [Design and Code Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Design-and-Code)

- Wes picks up subcontracting work for a studio in Raleigh!
- Wes talks on how he picks up bigger projects
- Wes is killin' his client work
- We talk about noisey lead generating data (it's all noisey)
- Wes emails friends and family to keep his business transparent and accountable
- Wes also emails his clients to generate leads
- We have a random business idea to completely automate different client lead funnels straight to freelancers
- We talk about plans for next week!

## Wes' advice for being a rock star at networking

Set aside 30 minutes before and after networking events to meet people.

Questions to ask:

- "What are you working on right now?"
- "What do you do?"
- "What is your specialty?"
- Come up with 3 to 4 questions to ask speakers during their presentation and ask
  them after.

When there is a group of three to four people. Listen to their conversation for
personal connections and bring up those connections during a pause.

If someone is in an unrelated industry ask them what is innovative in their
industry, what is new that industry, what are problems that that industry has?

Have a reason for people to come talk to you. Wes has shirts that say "I'm a web
developer."

Have business cards.

Follow up afterwards.

Force yourself to do it, because it's important.
