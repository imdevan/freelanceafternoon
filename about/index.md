We are two freelance developers at the beginning of our career. Both of us own and
operate one man development studios and attended Texas A&M University. Although,
we both met at Texas A&M (through hackathons üòè) we have pretty different backgrounds.

We made this podcast to help keep ourselves on track, and share knowledge with
anyone interested in starting a career as a freelance developer.
